### UCSI IET On Campus Event

### Mr Fauzi : Artificial Intelligence with Python
- Textbook: Make your own neural network

**Neural Networks Concept**
- Calculation: Summation of all the input time its weights respectively + bias
- output: function(Calculation)
- multiple layers with input serve as output in the intermediate layers steps
- deep neural network
- machine is just doing the mathematics operations
- use dataset to generate the algorithm to make the computation of applications
- might be multi-input or output
- engineers use data from sensors
- developing by iteration with comparison with the output (like your bisections)
- they just figure out the best value (machine learning), teaching them how to learn
- gradient descent methods (algorithm)
- most basics is the use of *linear function*, you can use non-linear also

**Type of Artificial Neural Networks**
- Forward Structure
- *sigmoid-threshold* function
- in general the equation is solved by matrix of input and the weight matrix operations, like a list representing your dataset of vectors manners
- compare with outputs true value functions
- *Recurrent Neural Network* is more robust towards conventional *Feedforward Neural Network* some sort of like a feedback control loops
- *ReLU function*

**ANN with Python**
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Tensorflow
5. Keras

**Model** is for making prediction and it is classified by **accuracy**.

**Activation Function** is to customize your function output into a certain range that is suitable for your.

**Coursera, MIT, DataCAMP, etc**
