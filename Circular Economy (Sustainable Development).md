### Circular Economy for Sustainable Development

- Sustainable Economy in the future
- *Sustainable Growth Strategy*: leading to a circular economy future
- Risk of climate change
- Solid Waste Pollution
- **Brundtland Commision** that meeds present need withoug compromising of fugure
  1. Concept of "needs"
  2. the ideal of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization

**Sustainable For Community**
- People
- Planet
- Profit
- Sustainable Environment -> Society -> Economy
- Sustainable needs collaboration

**Linear Economy, Product Value Chains** (no longer applicable)
1. Natural Resources
2. Industrial Processes, Distribution, Product Use
3. Waste & Pollution

**Circular Economy, Resources Value Cycles**
1. Natural Resources
2. Industrial Processes, Distribution, Product Use
- on the above steps trying to consider the environmental industry
- changing rules, jobs from discards, producer respobsibility, empowered customer, etc
- circular the food, energy, goods inside the cities which consume less energy needs and reduce the output, much like a recycle feed
- by developing zero waste concepts and implementation
- *Metabolisms* of a cities
3. Waste & Pollution

**Integral Value Chain Management**
1. Product use
2. End-of-life, and recycle, material extraction and processing, manufacturing of product, packaging and manufactures for redistributiosn

Methods involve landfilling, energy recovery, sorting, and collection

**Best practice in Netherlands**
1. Waste is end-of-pipe
  - stop wasiting waste by landfilling
  - increase waste Resources
2. Gains in the production cycle
  - save energy and raw materials
  - reduce carbon emissions
  - zero waste

**Circular Economy** needs:
- reuse (small changes, and reuse again)
- recycle
- remanufacture
- repair
- refurbish
- reduce resources, waste (by products), energy
- redistribute

**Linear Economy** -> **Chain Economy** -> **Chain Economy**

**Short Cycle**
- composting kitchen and green waste

**Long Cycle**
- biowaste collection on large scale
- use secondary materials for making new devices

- less packaging
- refull system
- food sold in bulk

**Zero Wate**: no discharge
- emerging as a paradism shift, a new socio-technical system to address our resource use from product design to disposal
- "cradle to cradle" like "grave to yard"

**4 Central Concept**
- changing the rules
- producer respobsibility
- purchasing for zero waste
- recouse recovery plant and infrastructure

**Practice by**
1. Transportation System
2. Use of ICT
3. Awareness Campaigns

**Resouces Recovery from zero waste**
- doing more with less resources
- technological valorization are water resue, resources volarization, and energy recovery
1. Impact Reduction
2. Energy Valorization
3. Resources Management
  - low energy nitrogen treatment
  - using existing infrastructure to achieve energy recovery

**Zero Waste as practice**
- *Smart Building* for a better pneumatic waste collection system instead of using gravity chutes (rodents, human contact, air posslution, carbon waste)
  - waste collection and use pneumatic control system
  - *Supreme Court of India*

**Barriers to transformation**
- mind changes
- resources laws based on linear and circular economic model
- people and planet centric view instead of profit centrac (economic)

**Conclusions**
- increasing interest in valorization
- potential market is huge
- research needed
- we should environmental cost which will turns *circular economy* into the cheapest one

**Questions and Answers**
- plastic pure form is not from volarization, because of the emmision of combustion gaseous upon its combustion, it can mostly be recycled
