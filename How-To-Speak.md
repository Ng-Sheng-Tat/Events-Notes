    - do not read
    - be in the image
    - keep images simple
    - eliminate clutter
- people are inspired when they see people are passionate about what they are doing
- teach people how to think by telling a story
- persuading by starting with the fundamentals and get tested by people who do not know the subject to review your presentation
- job-talks: show your vision (problems and approaches) and done something (projects, steps taken) within 5 minutes and enumerating your contributions
- how to make your idea famous by using symbols, slogan, story, salient, and surprise
- final slides or final words: ended by not asking a question slide, not stating collborators at the end (state at the beginning of the slide), not references, not "the end" slide, not ended by conclusion but ended by contributions
- give people time to read your slide pages
- ended by telling a joke
- not stating thank you
